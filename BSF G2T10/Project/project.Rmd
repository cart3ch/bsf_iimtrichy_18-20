```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
win.test<-read.csv("dota2Test_win.csv")

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Model
We made a logistic regression where we find how choosing a particular characters affects your probability of winning

#Logistic Regression Model

```{r}
m1.logit <- glm(data=win.test, result~., family=binomial)
summary(m1.logit)
```

# Exponential of Coefficients

```{r}
exp(m1.logit$coefficients)
```
